[19:30:47] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> you tried to troll me mf
[19:30:50] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> we will do it again
[19:30:55] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> LOL
[19:31:15] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> it literally become dumb
[19:31:21] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> you scared me
[19:32:12] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> what is huaberk?
[19:32:51] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> its an armor on MC
[19:32:54] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> oh
[19:33:01] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i had no idea about that
[19:33:06] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> ohh
[19:33:13] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i had no idea about time too
[19:33:14] [Async Chat Thread - #42/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> lol
[19:34:25] [Async Chat Thread - #43/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> do you think you are good at maths?
[19:34:29] [Async Chat Thread - #43/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> no
[19:34:30] [Async Chat Thread - #43/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> iidk if i am asking it agian
[19:35:04] [Async Chat Thread - #43/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> if you think youre good at maths, then youre not good at maths

[19:35:19] [Async Chat Thread - #43/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i am actually not good tho
[19:35:26] [Async Chat Thread - #43/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> me neither
[19:35:35] [Async Chat Thread - #43/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i want to getw
[19:36:35] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> But, I actually learn by myself maths
[19:36:42] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i cant do that
[19:36:46] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i need youtube
[19:36:48] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> youtube exist :/
[19:36:49] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> for that
[19:36:53] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> ik
[19:36:54] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> ik
[19:36:55] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> I use youtube
[19:37:03] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> But I plan to read a book
[19:37:14] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> On Friday the book will be at my house
[19:37:17] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> Is of linear algebra
[19:37:18] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> nice
[19:37:32] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> is number system easy for you?
[19:37:39] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> put an example
[19:37:48] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> cant in minecraft
[19:37:54] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i will send you photo on dc
[19:38:14] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> number system and polynomial make me cry
[19:38:28] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> hardest topic of maths for me rn
[19:38:29] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> yes, you currently are working probably on the real numbers R which have a estructure known as "body" which means it a conmutative group in the binary operations of plus and multiplicacion
[19:38:38] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> denoted as R(+,*)
[19:39:00] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i study about real numbers in 9th but didnt studied it
[19:39:11] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> that wasnt in my book what you said
[19:39:12] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> This is abstract algebra what I said to you
[19:39:20] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> wasnt in my book
[19:39:27] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> neither in mine
[19:39:33] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> how you studied?
[19:39:36] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> I leart it myself
[19:39:42] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> where from?
[19:39:43] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> youtube :/
[19:39:45] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> PDFS

[19:39:59] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> do you know about organic chemistry teacher?
[19:40:03] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> yes
[19:40:13] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> Its good for exercises, but not for theory
[19:40:13] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i am new to his channel
[19:40:27] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> I like to do proofs
[19:40:33] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> oh
[19:40:51] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> i will learn his topics from someone else who teachs in english or hindi
[19:40:59] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> mmm
[19:41:10] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> do you know the meaning of proof in Mathemathics?
[19:41:14] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> yeah
[19:41:24] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> I study that
[19:41:26] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <Xua057> A LOT
[19:41:27] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: [Not Secure] <SMITEX89> wth
